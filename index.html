                    <h2> RESUME </h2>
                    <p>&mdash; I am an Austrian-American actor, filmmaker, politician, and former professional bodybuilder and powerlifter. <b>I had many dreams in my life and I made them true</b>. I realized my dream of becoming the best body-builder in the world when won the <b>Mr Olympia title</b>.  I dreamt of becoming an actor, and tmy dream too was fulfilled as I went on to become <b>a big Hollywood star</b>. I was politically active and later on served as <b>the Governor of California</b> for two terms. I also have a philanthropic side and help many charitable organizations in their cause. After completing my second term as governor, I have retired from politics and am currently pursuing my acting career. </p>
